Qemu/win32 can be run using the mingw-subsystem or an alternative cli (cygwin was successfully 
tested with export PATH=".../mingw64/lib/qemu:.../mingw64/bin:$PATH")

Make sure you are using Windows 10 Pro and you've enabled WHPX OR you own an Intel CPU and
you've installed HAX. Otherwise no hardware acceleration can be used.

msys2.examples.tests.sh contains several demo use cases which can be automatically executed:
$ /mingw64/share/doc/qemu/msys2.examples.tests.sh

Most demo use cases were VMs taken from Qemu Advent Calendar https://www.qemu-advent-calendar.org/
which were adjusted to run on Qemu/win32.

Desktop use cases were integrated to show different options how to run a Linux desktop using
 * SPICE
 * SDL
 * GTK
 * VNC

All demo use cases can be used to perform a regression test, too:
The script supports comparing two specified versions of qemu by executing the use cases with 
both versions consecutively

Known problems with Qemu/win32:

* qemu-system-x86_64 -accel whpx
	in qemu 6.0.0 leads to error messages like
		WHPX: setting APIC emulation mode in the hypervisor
		whpx: injection failed, MSI (0, 0) delivery: 0, dest_mode: 0, trigger mode: 0, vector: 0, lost 
	which causes some problems, which can be mitigated by using 
	qemu-system-x86_64 -accel whpx,kernel-irqchip=off

* qemu-system-x86_64 -accel whpx -pflash /mingw64/lib/qemu/edk2-x86_64-code.fd
	using an UEFI BIOS with WHPX fails with
	qemu-system-x86_64.exe: WHPX: Failed to emulate MMIO access with EmulatorReturnStatus: 2
	qemu-system-x86_64.exe: WHPX: Failed to exec a virtual processor

* qemu-img commit doesn't work

* qemu-img convert to vhdx produces invalid images

* qemu-system-x86_64 -append root=/dev/hda
	absolute paths are converted to windows paths in MINGW64 shell
	and therefore get invalid, which can be mitigated:
	$ export MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL='*'
	$ qemu-system-x86_64.exe -append root=/dev/hda
	$ unset MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL
	Make sure you do not use any (absolute) paths in the command, which need to be converted
